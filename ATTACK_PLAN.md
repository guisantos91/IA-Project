### Steps to Predict the Opponent's Next Move

#### 1. **Identify the Opponent's Head and Tail**

   - We can Use the **sight data** to locate the body of the opponent (`SNAKE = 4` in our sight).
   - **Determine the head**:
    - The head is the part of the snake that moves into previously unoccupied spaces (PASSAGE = 0).
   - **Determine the tail**:
    - The tail moves to the position previously occupied by the second-to-last part of the body.

#### 2. **Generate Possible Moves**

   - From the head's position, generate all valid moves:
     - Up, Down, Left, Right (considering the map boundaries and whether wrapping is possible).
   - Filter out moves that lead to **immediate collision**:
     - Collision with walls (`STONE = 1`).
     - Collision with its own body (`SNAKE = 4`).

#### 3. **Evaluate the Best Move**
   Since you do not know the rules the opponent uses, consider these heuristics:
   - **Priority 1: Move towards food**:
     - If there is food (`FOOD` or `SUPER`) in the sight range, calculate the distance to each food and prioritise moves that minimise this distance.
   - **Priority 2: Avoid collisions**:
     - If a move leads to a higher collision risk (e.g., moving closer to walls or into a constrained area), deprioritise it.
   - **Priority 3: Default behaviour**:
     - If no food is nearby, assume the opponent will move straight unless forced to turn.

#### 4. **Predict Based on Observed Patterns**
   - As the game progresses, observe how the opponent reacts to various situations:
     - Does it always move towards the nearest food?
     - Does it avoid risky paths or favour open spaces?
   - Use this information to refine your prediction model dynamically during the game.

#### 5. **Handling Wrapping**
   - Since you do not know if the opponent can wrap (`self.traverse`), assume both scenarios:
     - **Traverse = True**: Include wraparound moves in possible directions.
     - **Traverse = False**: Exclude wraparound moves.
   - Adjust based on observed behaviour during the game.

Here are a few points to consider:

1. **Secure Approach (Assume always `self.traverse=True`)**:
   - **Pros**: Simple and avoids misjudgments; ensures robust predictions.
   - **Cons**: Misses opportunities to exploit the opponent's inability to wrap. Exploiting `self.traverse=False` can yield high rewards (e.g., forcing opponents into traps or beating them to food). 
   However, itâ€™s riskier and should be balanced with the game context (e.g., proximity to walls).

2. **Dynamic Adjustment Based on Observed Behaviour**:
   - **Worth It?**: Yes, if your strategy values exploiting weaknesses.
   - **Which indicators to look on?**: Observing an opponent not wrapping around or avoid internall walls is a strong indicator of `self.traverse=False`.
   - **Duration to Maintain `self.traverse=True`**: Adjust dynamically:
     - Start with `self.traverse=True` by default.
     - If the opponent behaves as if `self.traverse=False` (e.g., avoids edges), assume `self.traverse=False` but revert to `self.traverse=True` if they suddenly wrap.
     - A **few steps (~5-10)** is reasonable to mantain the `self.traverse=False`, after that we should have a more secure approach and assume `self.traverse=True`. Food and poison effects can alter the opponent's traverse state.

#### 6. **Influencing the Opponent**
   - If you want to attack the opponent, position your snake to:
     - Block their likely paths to food.
     - Force them into risky areas or collisions.
